## 🚀 About the Project  
NextStep is a **React Native** application developed during the **Odoo x CHARUSAT Hackathon** to empower marginalized communities by providing tools for civic engagement. The platform helps users **influence policy decisions, report local issues, and participate in community initiatives**.

## 📌 Problem Statement  
Marginalized communities often **struggle to access public services or influence policy decisions** that affect them, limiting their ability to drive positive social change.

## 💡 Our Solution  
NextStep bridges the gap between **local authorities and citizens** by providing:  
- **Community Initiatives** – Crowdsourcing ideas for public improvement (waste management, park development, etc.).  
- **Access to Services** – Streamlined interfaces for applying for government benefits, reporting issues, and accessing health services.  
- **Policy Participation** – Tools for tracking local government actions, participating in surveys, and contacting representatives.
